Mini project: Image classifier using PyTorch (MNIST).
# Week 1 - Image Classifier (PyTorch)

This repo documents my first AI project as part of my 3-month self-study plan.
- Setup: Google Colab + PyTorch
- Today: Tested PyTorch installation & ran basic tensor operations
- Next step: Build a simple feedforward network on MNIST
## Day 2 Progress
- Loaded MNIST dataset with PyTorch
- Understood DataLoader for batching
- Visualized first handwritten digits
