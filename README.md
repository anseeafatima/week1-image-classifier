# Week 1 - Image Classifier (PyTorch)

This repository documents my daily progress while building an image classifier using **PyTorch**.  
The goal is to understand deep learning fundamentals and practice a consistent workflow: **data â†’ model â†’ training â†’ evaluation â†’ deployment**.

## ðŸ“… Daily Progress

### Day 1 âœ…
- Set up PyTorch in Google Colab
- Created first tensors and did basic operations
- Linked Google Colab with GitHub for version control

### Day 2 âœ…
- Loaded the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset**
- Learned how to use **PyTorch DataLoader**
- Visualized sample digits with Matplotlib

### Day 3 âœ…
- Built my **first neural network** (3 fully connected layers) in PyTorch
- Trained on MNIST dataset (1 epoch â†’ ~90% accuracy)
- Tested on unseen data & visualized predictions
- ðŸ”¥ First milestone achieved: working AI model!

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Improve accuracy by training longer
- Experiment with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- Document learning in each notebook
